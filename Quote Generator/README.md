## Code Explanation

### HTML (index.html)

### JavaScript (Quote Generator Logic.js)

- `quotes_object`: An object containing ten quotes, each with a quote and author.

- `button`: Selects the "New Quote" button from the HTML.

- `no_of_quotes`: Tracks the current quote number.

- `change(e)`: Event listener function that updates the displayed quote and author when the "New Quote" button is clicked.
